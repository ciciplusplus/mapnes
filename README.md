# üó∫Ô∏èüìçüéÆ Mapnes
Backend for 8-bit maps for NES 

<div align="center" width="100%">

</div>

<br>
There are two layers:

- one constructed from raw Google maps images using 16x16 tiles
- one with layer of geospatial labels from NaturalEarth data rendered with Mapnik

## üñºÔ∏è Tiles

While tiles from original video are similar to DragonQuest/DragonWarrior one, for obivous reasons I cannot release them publically. Tiles presented in this repo were modified from those tile sets:

- [8 bit color RPG tileset](https://opengameart.org/content/8-bit-color-rpg-tileset) (CC BY-SA 4.0 license)
- [8-bit JRPG tilesets](https://opengameart.org/content/8-bit-jrpg-tilesets) (CC0 1.0 license)
- [Some other 8-bit vertical shooter assets](https://opengameart.org/content/some-other-8-bit-vertical-shooter-assets) (CC0 1.0 license)

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies

Server is written in Python and running on [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/).
You should also install [Mapnik](https://mapnik.org/) for labels to work.

#### Ubuntu
Tested on Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS with Python 3.8 and pip 20.0.2

```
pip install requests # network calls
pip install Flask # server
pip install Pillow # image library

sudo apt install libmapnik3.0 # cartographic library
sudp apt install python3-mapnik # mapnik bindings to python
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: If you installed Flask on local env, it may not find Mapnik installed globally. The easiest fix here is to install Flask globally as well.

#### Google API account

Google API key is required for map to load, you should register and get one following this guide https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key <br>
Once obtained, place it instead `YOUR_API_KEY` in [./static/index.html](./static/index.html)

If you have error message on load after that, make sure that:

- "Maps JavaScript API" is enabled in [the console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library?project=mapnes)
- Billing account is created (Google API have free trial with no-auto charge after it's end)

## üëü Run

`FLASK_ENV=development flask run --host=0.0.0.0`

You will be able access it directly in browser http://localhost:5000/ <br><br>
*In my setup I expose server to local network, so cartridge can connect to it too, that's why 0.0.0.0 binding is necessary.*
